To get the VOC data, I believe I just created a download/ folder at the top
level of this repo, and I followed this part of the original README.md:

    https://github.com/rudyjantz/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Object-Detection#download

    Download

    Specfically, you will need to download the following VOC datasets –

        2007 trainval (460MB)

        2012 trainval (2GB)

        2007 test (451MB)

    Consistent with the paper, the two trainval datasets are to be used for
    training, while the VOC 2007 test will serve as our test data.

    Make sure you extract both the VOC 2007 trainval and 2007 test data to the
    same location, i.e. merge them.

The README.md file has them hyperlinked.

To merge VOC 2007 trainval and 2007 test, I just `tar xf`'d  them into the same
folder.


And then I just followed the first steps of Training in README.md:
    https://github.com/rudyjantz/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Object-Detection#training

    Training

    Before you begin, make sure to save the required data files for training
    and evaluation. To do this, run the contents of create_data_lists.py after
    pointing it to the VOC2007 and VOC2012 folders in your downloaded data.

    See train.py.

    The parameters for the model (and training it) are at the beginning of the
    file, so you can easily check or modify them should you need to.

    To train your model from scratch, run this file –

      python train.py

One last note: I renamed this repo's folder to object-detection before running
any experiments with train.py
